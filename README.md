## Description
This Pig Dice is a game of dice where 2 players participate at a time. In this case, Player 1 and player two.


## Game Rules
* The game has 2 players, playing in rounds
* In each turn, a player rolls a dice as many times as he wishes. Each result get added to his ROUND score
* BUT, if the player rolls a 1, all his ROUND score gets lost. After that, it's the next player's turn
* The player can choose to 'Hold', which means that his ROUND score gets added to his GLOBAL score. After that, it's the next player's turn
* The first player to reach 100 points on GLOBAL score wins the game


## Game Play
On a turn, a player rolls the die repeatedly until either:
* 1 is rolled
* The player chooses to hold (stop rolling)
* If the player chooses to hold, all of the points rolled during that turn are added to his or her score.


## Technologies Used
I used HTML, css/styles,js/scripts,js/bootstrap, terminal and atom.
